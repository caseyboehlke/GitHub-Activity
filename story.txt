  Once upon a time there was a place called the University of Wisconsin-Madison. At
this university, there was a group of students taking CS400 who had to do a GitHub
project together. In this project, they had to write a story in a file called
story.txt. The student responsible for the first paragraph is named Casey Boehlke.
Casey sat at his desk and was unable to come up with a creative idea for a story,
so he decided to simply describe the assignment.
  All of a sudden, Casey was hit with a burst of inspiration. He grabbed his coat,
and ventured out into the sleeping city. The moon was high in the sky. He shivered 
as the crisp night air cut through his coat like a knife through butter. It was cold.
Bitterly cold. But Casey knew that he must reach his destination, before it was too late.
  Casey trudged and trudged, dodging cop cars and crazy college kids. He must get there before 
it is too late. He jumped over the construction holes in the sidewalk and ran and ran. Finally he made 
it to Bascom hill! With little thought he climbed the hill and sat in Abe Lincoln's lap. This was it. 
Because Casey made it to Abe before the clock striked 00:00, peace was restored, and Casey would forever
be a hero.
