  Once upon a time there was a place called the University of Wisconsin-Madison. At
this university, there was a group of students taking CS400 who had to do a GitHub
project together. In this project, they had to write a story in a file called
story.txt. The student responsible for the first paragraph is named Casey Boehlke.
Casey sat at his desk and was unable to come up with a creative idea for a story,
so he decided to simply describe the assignment.
  All of a sudden, Casey was hit with a burst of inspiration. He grabbed his coat,
and ventured out into the sleeping city. The moon was high in the sky. He shivered 
as the crisp night air cut through his coat like a knife through butter. It was cold.
Bitterly cold. But Casey knew that he must reach his destination, before it was too late.
